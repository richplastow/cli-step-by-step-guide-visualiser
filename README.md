## Overview

Given a markdown file docs/guides/how-to-use-some-command.md like this:

````md
# How to use `some-command`

This is just an example step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Check that `some-command` is installed

```bash
# The `--version` or `-v` flag makes some-command exit without doing anything.
some-command --version
# v1.2.3
```
````

Running `node ./visualise.js docs/guides/how-to-use-some-command.md`
generates a docs/guides/how-to-use-some-command.html file - a much more
user-friendly way to work with the step-by-step guide.

Run `open docs/guides/how-to-use-some-command.html` to view in your browser.
